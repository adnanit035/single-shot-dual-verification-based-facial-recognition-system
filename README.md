# single-shot-dual-verification-based-facial-recognition-system

## Project Description
This repository contains the code for a single-shot dual verification-based facial recognition system, a web app implementation of [A2SR - Advanced Autonomous Security Robot](https://github.com/adnanit035/A2SR) project. The system is designed to recognize and verify the identity of a person in a single shot using a dual verification process. The system uses a combination of facial recognition and voice recognition to verify the identity of a person over a CCTV live feed.
